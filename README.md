# bulk issue creation for adapter repos

third time is the charm, i've finally figured out how to not create duplicative issues.

1. install GitHub CLI and authenticate
2. ensure `repos.txt` is up to date
3. update the issue body text in `update_14.md`
4. update the `issue_title` within `issue_create_14.sh`
5. execute `bash issue_create_14.sh`

## acknowledgement

full credit to those whose work was subsequently scraped and made available by ChatGPT. Couldn't have done it without you. Rather, I could have, but I would have had to fiddle around quite a  bit longer
